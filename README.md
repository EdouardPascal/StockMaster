# StockMaster
This is my first big Java project. It is a GUI program with Java and Swing framework that emulates the stock market and allows users to buy or  sell ~1000 stocks of their choice. It uses a SQL database for login and user authentification purposes as well as keeping track of user's balances and stock inventory. The app support operations such as buying/selling stocks, depositing and retracting funds(not real funds)The app allow user to research stocks and provide the current price as well as a graph(using the JfreeChart library) made of the historical data from up to 1Year. The app use the Jsoup library to parse through the HTML link from the google finance website.
